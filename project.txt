Project:
A data analysis project to explore how parient inflammation changes over time after surgery.

People:
Jane is a Data Scientist.
Samit is a Statistician.

We will need to determine who is responsible for what in this project.
We will probably need a programmer.
This person will need to be competent in R or Python, preferally both.

I have added this line.

The programmer also needs to be familiar with Pandas, Matplotlib abd ggplot.
